# React Template with Typescript

ðŸ“ƒ A simple React template, created using `create-react-app` with Typescript. 



## Getting Started ðŸ› 

This project is a personal project to create React template with Typescript with some functionality such as routing configuration, form management, or state management using redux. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installing 

Intall the dependencies using `npm`

```shell
npm install
```

### Running the app

You can use all the available script that you normally use when creating project with `create-react-app`. For example to run the app simply typing

```shell
npm run start
```

This will run the app with default setting in [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).



## List of Feature ðŸ—’

As this will be a template, I hope i can give at least the basic functionality that we can get from a basic app. Below is the feature I plan to implement.

- [x] Basic template from `create-react-app`
- [ ] Simple routing management
- [ ] Simple form management using hooks
- [ ] Simple state management (probably will using Redux with hooks)
